# Required for Soldering

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rgoulter/keyboard-labs/master/docs/images/buildlog-rev2021.4-minimal/tools.JPG" />

- Soldering iron.
  - Even a very cheap one will do.

- Soldering iron stand.

- Fume Extractor/Filter.
  - Especially if you're soldering indoors.

- Solder.
  - I would strongly recommend using better-than-the-cheapest solder.
    My experience with cheap solder is that it doesn't have enough flux,
    which makes soldering difficult.

- A sponge, or brass wool, for cleaning solder from the soldering iron.

- Desoldering sucker, or desoldering wick.
  - A cheap desoldering sucker should be able to do the job.
    However, I'd recommend getting nicer-than-cheapest because
    if you're using a desoldering sucker,
    you'll want to reduce frustration experienced.
    (Especially if desoldering MX keyswitches).

- Flush cutters.

- Soldering mat; or cardboard or whatever to protect the surface from
  damage while soldering.

# Recommended Tools

- Digital Mulitmeter.
  - The most useful functionality here is the continuity check.
  - Take care, most cheap multimeters don't switch off automatically,
    which results in the battery draining completely
    after use if the multimeter isn't switched off.

- Bevel/chisel soldering iron tip.
  - Not strictly necessary, but it's what I used in this build.

- Needle-nosed pliers.

- Tweezers.

- Wire stripper / Jumper wire.
  - In many cases, jumper wire can be used to 'repair' a connection between
    keyboard switches, or fix other small mistakes/damages.

# Nice to Have

- Twin-Headed Soldering Iron
  - If you're going to do a lot of soldering of SMD diodes/resistors/etc.,
    then it's very useful to have twin-headed soldering tweezers.

- Hot Air Gun
  - Makes it easier to solder SMD components.

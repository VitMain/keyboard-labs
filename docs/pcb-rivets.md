# PCB Rivets for Hot Swapping

A pair of "PCB rivets" is about 1/5 the cost of a Kailh socket
(e.g. comparing [from TheGioiIC](https://www.thegioiic.com/products/pcb-rivet-1-2mm)
 in HCMC, VN
 vs [from YMDK on AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003575767699.html);
 though I don't know where else M1.2 can be sourced).
PCB rivets also don't require a specialised PCB footprint for the switches.

In my experience, M1.5 PCB rivets work for MX switches,
and M1.2 for Choc switches.

## Example of using M1.2 "PCB Rivets" with Kailh Choc v1 switches

Using M1.2 "PCB Rivets" to allow hot-swapping Kailh Choc v1 switches.

Here are some pictures:
